The following directory contains the files of the optimization framework, SIMULATE-3 input model for a generic SMR, and coincident input and output files generated by the optimization framework.
Any modifications to the input file will require coincident modifications to the optimzation framework such as the fuel assembly IDs for enrichment and burnable absorber optimization and names of the input file.
